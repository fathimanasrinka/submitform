This project is a simple and responsive Submit Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to enter their Name, Phone Number, Email, and Location, and then submit the details through a clean, interactive interface.

The form validates user input using JavaScript before submission, ensuring that all required fields are filled correctly.
Itâ€™s a great beginner-friendly project to understand form handling, validation, and front-end interaction.
